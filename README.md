# Data-Mining
This project consists of analysing music tracks in order to create classification models using Data Mining and Machine Learning techniques.
The dataset consists of a collection of tracks from a free archive, available at: mdeff/fma.
We decided to focus our attention on the recognition of songs with the genre "Old Time/Historic" to avoid proposing it to those using the collection.

The analysis focused on:

• Unbalanced learning and Anomaly detection

• Classification methods: KNN, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, rule-based classifiers, logistic regression, SVM, Random-Forest and Neural Networks

• Time Series analysis

• Sequential Pattern Mining and Advanced Clustering

• AI Explaianbility
